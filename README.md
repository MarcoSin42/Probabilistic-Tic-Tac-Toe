# Welcome to Probabilistic* JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe Simulator Project

The project is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript. This is a variation on Tic-Tac-Toe where upon selection a cell has a chance of being an 'X','O', or merely being empty!

I was inspired by this probabilistic Tic-Tac-Toe game and initially read about it on HackerNews:

I wanted to find out optimal strategies and investigate how optimal play changes based on the state of the board.  The AI uses Monte Carlo Tree search to determine optimal moves.

Some things I want to find out:

1. How does fiddling with the odds change how likely it is for one player to win or another?

1. What is the minimal amount I must tip the scales in order for one player to consistently win X% of the time?  (Assuming optimal play on both sides)

1. How likely is it for one player to win over another?

Since I'm lazy and don't want to make Yet Another Tic-Tac-Toe game, I shamelessly forked the Tic-Tac-Toe interface from tanhongit.
